TASKS
    [ ] Implement the control ROM into separate state registers
        [ ] ctrl_IF_ID ==> Steven
        [ ] ctrl_ID_EX ==> Steven
        [ ] ctrl_EX_MEM ==> Benoit
            [ ] Read in ctrl for the opcode and load_funct3 = load_funct3_t'(funct3) or store_funct3
            [ ] Set the mem_byte_enable, write, and read bits for data cache
            [x] rs2_out is the data_wdata
        [ ] ctrl_MEM_WB ==> Scott
    [ ] Link the state registers to the rest of cpu_datapath
        [ ] Link ctrl_IF_ID to IF and ID ==> Steven
        [ ] Link ctrl_ID_EX to ID and EX ==> Steven
        [ ] Link ctrl_EX_MEM to EX and MEM ==> Benoit
        [ ] Link ctrl_MEM_WB to MEM and WB ==> Scott
    [ ] Run through the caches to make sure the logic is right ==> Scott
    [x] Include the provided modules from MP3 (ALU, comp, regfile...)
    [ ] Figure out whether I want to send a signal out indicating IDLE state for I-Cache ==> Scott
    [ ] Progress report
    [ ] Arbiter design
    [ ] Branch clear
        [ ] Finish State Ex
        [ ] Make the necessary connections EX --> EX_MEM
        [ ] Lead br_en (1 if branch and comp, and 1 if jump instruction) coming out of EX_MEM into IF, which is also PC mux sel 
        [ ] If br_en / pc_mux_sel == 1, then pass a variable to the first 3 state registers to reset them

SCOTT FOR TOMORROW
    [ ] pc_out and inst_address are redundant, can be one signal
    [ ] inst_rdata being pointed into id, should be in IF ID first
    [ ] have to implement inst_resp logic in IF ID reg so it can properly read

QUESTIONS

Things to Keep in Mind
1. Before the host closes laptop / server, commit and push the code to github
2. Before starting, message Discord chat, start up server, and share the server link
3. When working, stay in voice chat, even if muted

How to Share the server
1. SSH first
2. Open the Live Share server
3. Select the folder to open

Functionalities
1. Branch static misprediction
2. Pipeline state registers
3. All the arithmetic mentioned in the spec
3. Load and Stores

Testing Strategies
We utilized the dual port magic memory to test our pipeline, but we were not able to pass all the funcitonalities for we are still
implementing the design.
