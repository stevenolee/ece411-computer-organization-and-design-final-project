TASKS FOR CHECKPOINT 2
    [ ] Data Forwarding
        [ ] Finish linking rs2 in EX state
        [ ] Double check logic for rs1 links in EX
        [ ] Finish linking links for data_load
            [ ] Put data_rdata into the respective rs_reg in EX 
                (add an input to the mux, add a bit to the mux_sel, which is just hazard_load)
    [ ] Stalls for data fowarding - Benoit
        [ ] Should only happen when data_loads are being executed
        [ ] Input stall variable into all state reg's before the data_load, have additional
            logic in those registers that will hold off from reading the next input, and also
            prevent PC from updating (load_pc = 0)
    [ ] Arbiter
        [x] Priority between d_cache and i_cache when both want to use it
        [ ] Finish implementing Arbiter - Scott



DEBUG TIPS
    [ ] Make sure to check the ALU inputs (from forwarding) to be updating correctly
        [ ] Otherwise, link outputs from previous instructions to ID --> IF_ID
